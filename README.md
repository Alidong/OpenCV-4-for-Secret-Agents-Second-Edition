*&#9758; **I am using OpenCV 4** throughout the book and this repository. Even in OpenCV 4, the name `cv2` is still used for OpenCV's Python module. Here, `cv2` does not refer to the version number; it refers to the Python wrapper around OpenCV's newer C++ API as opposed to the older C API.*

## External Datasets and Tools to Train Haar and LBP Cascades

The cascade training script at `Chapter003/cascade_training/train.bat` (for Windows) or `Chapter003/cascade_training/train.sh` (for Mac or Linux) depends on datasets and tools that are not part of this repository or of OpenCV 4. Closer to the time of the book's publication, this README will be updated with details about obtaining these datasets and tools.
